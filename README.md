# seq geom parser

This is a `rust` crate for parsing the sequence fragment geometry description language (FGDL).
This language is used to characterize the "geometry" of different sequencing technologies, in 
terms of how different positions and patterns in the sequenced reads encode information about 
the origin of the fragment (e.g. cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers).

[More details about the FGDL and the formal specification of the language can be found here.](https://hackmd.io/@PI7Og0l1ReeBZu_pjQGUQQ/rJMgmvr13)
